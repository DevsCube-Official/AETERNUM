### Learning abilities

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Use `/loot give @s loot aeternum:scrolls/...` to give yourself class scrolls

Throughout your journey in the minecraft world, you may find **class scrolls** (obtained from dungeon merchants as of alpha release), which are the various abilities your class gives you. To add a class scroll to your unlocked abilties, you may use the "Use a class scroll" menu in the class table.

![Learning Abilities](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/a857eb76c65cac06aab2cbe1d58463cef73f0576.png)

Each class scroll can only be used in this menu **if you have the required class and its required level.** This information can be seen in the tooltip of the scroll.

</details>

### Selecting an Ability

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

As Aeternum offers 500 unique abilties, this menu will serve as a guide to keep track of them all. Here you can **select abilities to put in your ability wheel, remove them from the slots in the ability wheel, and scroll through 24 pages of possible abilities to choose from** (that is, if you unlocked all of them).

![Example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f873f856bfe9eb158caab2b40f2b72ff1122e913.png)
![Example 2](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/4de420dd97a75fedc3847ae710531d62b9d4aa78.png)

- Clicking on the number button (between the arrow buttons) will cycle between all the ability wheel slots you can modify
- Left-clicking on an ability will result in that ability being selected
- The arrow buttons will change pages
- The button on the top right (when clicked on) will show all the abilities that are currently in the ability wheel.
- The green button below it clears the currently selected slot.

</details>

### Ability types

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

- Activated: activate when used through the ability wheel item.
- Passive: will give you passive effects, as long as the ability is in the ability wheel.
- Key: grant you access to special items only available to specific classes, with unique effects such as increased reach or attack damage!

</details>

### Ability wheel and Ability slots

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

The ability wheel is the item that lets you use all of your active-type abilities.
It cannot be removed from the inventory.

When holding it in hand, you will see the amount of **energy** you have on the bottom, and you can **rightclick to activate an ability,** or put the item in **offhand (F by default) to swap between your available ability wheel slots.

When using an ability, it will consume your energy. Each ability will use up various amounts of EN. If you do not have enough EN for an ability, you cannot use that ability.

![Example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f6d87fe1fe450726c0432670904118bb46edc306.png)

Unlocking ability wheel slots is pretty straightforward. When you level up your first class, you will automatically unlock new ability wheel slots. **The maximum amount of ability wheel slots is 8.** This is to balance the features in the datapack.

</details>

### Energy

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

The energy system works as a system to make sure you can't use too many abilities at once.

- It regenerates like normal health.
- *Generally* an ability costs an EN amount equivalent to the level of the ability to use.
- Passive abilities and Key abilities do not use EN.
- Your current amount of EN displayed when you hold the ability wheel.
- A different icon will show depending on your current class. (Have fun seeing them in survival - or by ripping them from the resourcepack!)
